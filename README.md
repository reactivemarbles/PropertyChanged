# Reactive Marbles Property Changed

A framework for providing an observable with the latest value of a property expression.

Will use Expression trees on platforms that support it (no iOS based platforms). On iOS it will just use reflection. This provides a roughly 2x performance boost for those platforms that can use expression trees.

```cs
this.WhenPropertyChanges(x => x.Property1.Property2.Property3);
```

The above will generate a `IObservable<T>` where T is the type of `Property3`. It will signal each time a value has changed. It is aware of all property changes in the property chain.

# Binding

There are several methods of binding.

First is two way binding. Two way binding will update either the `host` or the `target` whenever the target property has changed.

```cs
host.Bind(target, host => host.B.C, target => target.D.E);
```

One way binding will only update the `target` with changes  the `host`'s specified target property.

```cs
host.OneWayBind(target, host => host.B.C);
```

There are also overloads with lambdas that allow you to convert from the `host` to the `target`. These will allow you to convert at binding time to the specified formats.

```cs
host.OneWayBind(target, host => host.B.C, hostProp => ConvertToTargetPropType(hostProp));
host.Bind(target, host => host.B.C, target => target.D.E, hostProp => ConvertToTargetPropType(hostProp), targetProp => ConvertToHostPropType(targetProp));
```

# Limitations compared to ReactiveUI

At the moment it only supports `INotifyPropertyChanged` properties. More property types to come such as WPF DependencyProperty.

# Milestones 

* Implement initial binding and property changes.
* Introduce AOP for allow removal of expressions.

# Benchmark Comparisons
